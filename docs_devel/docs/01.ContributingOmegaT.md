# Contributing to OmegaT development

Main development is performed in the `master` branch of the SourceForge-hosted
Git repository:
  [https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/code/ci/master/tree/](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/code/ci/master/tree/)

A GitHub mirror is also provided:
  [https://github.com/omegat-org/omegat](https://github.com/omegat-org/omegat)

If you would like to submit a patch, the recommended procedure is as follows:

0. Consider opening a discussion on the developers' list first:
  [http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/omegat-development](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/omegat-development)

1. Open a ticket for your change.

  * If it's a bug fix, create a Bug ticket:
   [https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/bugs/)

  *   If it's a new feature or enhancement, open a Request For Enhancement (RFE):
   [https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/](https://sourceforge.net/p/omegat/feature-requests/)

2. If you prefer to work with file-based patches, attach your patch to the
   ticket.  If you prefer to work with pull requests, fork the OmegaT project on
   GitHub and open a pull request.

3. Patches/PRs will be reviewed by a core developer. If accepted, the changes
   will be committed to master by the reviewer.
